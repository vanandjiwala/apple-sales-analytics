## Project Setup

We have used `uv` as a project manager so you need to perform the following steps in order to setup the project on your machine:

1. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if not done
2. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/install/) on your machine.
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/vanandjiwala/apple-sales-analytics.git`
4. CD in tot the directory using command `cd apple-sales-analytics`
5. Use command `uv sync` to set everything up
6. In order to run the script use `.venv/bin/activate` command. (For windows, the command will be a little different.)
